; provided by "realtime" at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5558492/divide-by-10-using-bit-shifts

; The algorithm multiplies the dividend by the recipricoal of the divisor, which in this case
; is 1/10. Since 10 cannot be represented perfectly in binary, a close approximation is used.
; After the remainder is calculated, the result is then corrected. However, the appx. result can still be off a
